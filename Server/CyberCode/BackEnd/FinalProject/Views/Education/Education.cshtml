            <h2>What is Phishing?</h2>
            <p>
                Phishing is a type of cyber attack where attackers deceive individuals into revealing sensitive
                information such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal details. This is
                typically achieved through deceptive emails, websites, or messages that appear to be from legitimate
                sources. The goal of phishing is often to gain access to accounts, commit fraud, or steal personal
                information.

            <h2>How Phishing Attacks Work</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Preparation:</strong> Attackers gather information about the target, such as their
                    interests, job role, or recent activities, to craft a convincing message.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Bait:</strong> The attacker sends an email, message, or creates a website that looks
                    legitimate. Common tactics include pretending to be from a trusted entity like a bank, social media
                    site, or a company the target does business with.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Hook:</strong> The message contains a call to action, such as clicking a link, downloading
                    an attachment, or providing personal information. The message often induces urgency or fear to
                    prompt quick action.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Capture:</strong> If the target falls for the bait, they are redirected to a fake website
                    where they are asked to enter sensitive information. Alternatively, they might download malware that
                    captures their data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Exploitation:</strong> The attacker uses the captured information for fraudulent activities,
                    such as unauthorized transactions, identity theft, or further attacks.
                </li>
            </ol>
